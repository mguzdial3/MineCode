MineCode is a set of seven lessons designed to teach basic programming concepts through the process of building and fixing existing computer games. It covers—in abbreviated form—the essentials of computer programming that one might learn in a semester-long university course. It is not a substitute for a university programming course, but will give hands on experience with programming concepts that will bootstrap further self-learning. Our philosophy is to allow the learner to jump in and immediately start fixing and making games. Computer games are necessarily complicated. Whereas many programing courses require a degree of slogging through abstract concepts before putting them to good use in projects that are not trivial and divorced from real things, our goal is to get readers hands dirty with computer game code as quickly as possible.

In the "Lessons" folder you will find the main "minecode.pdf" that contains all seven lessons or the individual lesson pdf's. These are designed for individual instruction at the student's pace, but can be used in a group setting.
